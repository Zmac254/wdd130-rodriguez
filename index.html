        <h2>About the Founder</h2>
        <p>The founder of BandLive found himself looking at all sorts of complicated and unsorted
            navigation from many other ticketing sites. He wanted an easy and simple no nonsense way to
            get tickets for his favorite bands. He ended up spending over a thousand dollars on just ticketing
            alone as well! So he finally got together with a group of developers that helped him create what
            is now BandLive. Despite only hosting 2 genres of music, people love the easy and cheap
            ticketing that you simply can’t find elsewhere. After founding BandLive, the founder has
            donated over 1 billion dollars to charities across the globe. </p>

        <h2>Our Objective</h2>
        <p>Us at BandLive are ever updating and looking for the most perfect blend of ease of life elements
            while also keeping our tickets cheap. We hope that you buy or membership, or donate money to
            continue this cause. We look forward to the future where many more genres and artists can
            outsource their music to a broad audience like that of BandLive. Thank you for your support! </p>
